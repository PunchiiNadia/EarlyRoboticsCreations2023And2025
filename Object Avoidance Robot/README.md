# 🤖 Arduino-Based Obstacle Avoidance Robot (2023)

This project marks my first hands-on experience with Arduino, motors, and sensors. I followed and adapted an online tutorial to build a robot that detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. Through iteration, wiring corrections, and component adjustments, I gained my first real understanding of how hardware and software interact in real-world conditions.

## 🎯 Objective
To learn Arduino fundamentals and gain practical experience in assembling circuits, programming motors and sensors, and troubleshooting physical robotic systems.

## 🧩 Role and Contribution
I built and assembled the robot myself while asking for guidance when needed. My key contributions included:
- Adjusting Arduino code (motor speed, timing, and sensor distance values).
- Replacing the low-voltage battery with a **7.4V Li-Po battery** after diagnosing power issues.
- Improving stability by adding **Plastwood** as a structural support base.
- Correcting wiring errors with help from my teacher and father, strengthening both understanding and collaboration.

## ⚙️ Tools and Components
- **Arduino Uno**, **Motor Driver Shield**
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **TT Gear Motors** (x2)
- **Micro Servo Motor MG90S (180° rotation)**
- **7.4V Li-Po Battery (550–900mAh)**, **DC Power Switch**
- **DC Male Adapter Jack (5.5 × 2.5 mm)**
- **Plastwood** base for stability
- **C++ / Arduino IDE** for programming
- Basic wiring tools

## 🔧 Development Process
1. Followed the tutorial to assemble the core structure and code.
2. Experimented with motor speeds and delay values to refine movement.
3. Identified power limitations and replaced the battery with a Li-Po.
4. Performed trial runs and adjusted chassis stability using Plastwood.
5. Final result: The robot successfully detected and avoided objects but sometimes spun in circles due to directional imbalance.

## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Wiring confusion as a beginner | Learned correct wiring logic with guidance from teacher and father |
| Robot not moving even with correct code | Diagnosed low voltage issue and replaced battery with Li-Po |
| Robot instability | Added Plastwood structural support to balance chassis |

## ✅ Outcome
The robot was **partially successful**. It could detect and avoid close obstacles, but movement stability was not yet consistent. Even so, it served as an important milestone—my first working robot and a meaningful step into robotics.

## 💡 Reflection
**Technical:** Learned Arduino wiring, motor driver usage, sensor integration, and practical debugging.  
**Personal:** Built patience, persistence, and resilience through trial-and-error problem solving.  
**Relational:** Learned the value of seeking guidance and support from others—progress in engineering is rarely done alone.  
**Vision:** Realized that even simple robot behaviors can be the foundation for creating future robots that interact, respond, and grow alongside people.
