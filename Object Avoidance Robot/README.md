# 🤖 Arduino-Based Obstacle Avoidance Robot (2023)

This project marks my first hands-on experience with Arduino, motors, and sensors. I followed and adapted an online tutorial to build a robot that detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. Through iteration, wiring corrections, and material substitutions, I gained foundational experience in how hardware and software interact in real-world conditions.

## 🎯 Objective
Learning Arduino fundamentals and gain practical experience in assembling circuits, programming motors and sensors, and troubleshooting physical robotic systems.

---

## 🧩 Role and Contribution
I assembled the robot independently while asking for guidance when needed. My contributions included:
- Adjusting Arduino code (motor speed, timing, and sensor distance values).
- Replacing the 9V battery with a 7.4V Li-Po to provide stable power for motors and sensors.
- Improving chassis stability by using Plastwood as the base, substituting for the acrylic material shown in the tutorial due to availability.
- Correcting wiring errors with help from my teacher and father, strengthening clarity in circuit logic and collaborative problem-solving.
- Updating the circuit diagram to fix the spinning issue and to support future rebuilds.

## 🔧 Development Process
1.	Following the tutorial to assemble the core structure and code.
2.	Experimenting with motor speeds and delay values to refine responsiveness.
3.	Replacing the original 9V battery with a 7.4V Li-Po to provide stable motor and sensor power.
4.	Performing trial runs and improving stability by adding Plastwood structural support at the base.
5.	Final result: The robot successfully detected and avoided objects but sometimes spun in circles due to directional imbalance.
6.	Later reviewing the wiring layout and circuit diagram to identify incorrect motor polarity as the cause of the spinning behavior and documenting the corrected layout for future rebuild.

## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Wiring confusion as a beginner** | Learning correct wiring logic with guidance from teacher and father. |
| **Robot not moving even with correct code** | Identifying insufficient power delivery from 9V battery and switching to a 7.4V Li-Po. |
| **Robot spinning in circles** | Not resolving during the build. Later realizing the cause was incorrect motor polarity when reviewing the project. Updating the circuit diagram to support future rebuild and learning. |
| **Chassis instability** | Adding Plastwood base to improve balance and support. |

## ✅ Outcome
The robot was **partially successful**. It could detect and avoid close obstacles, but movement stability was not yet consistent and still required improvement. Despite this, it served as a meaningful introduction to robotic systems and iterative engineering.

## 💡 Reflection
**Technical:** Learning Arduino wiring, motor driver usage, sensor integration, and hands-on debugging in physical builds.  
**Personal:** Developing patience, persistence, and resilience through trial-and-error problem solving and repeated iteration.  
**Relational:** Learning to reach out and receive help, realizing that engineering progress is not a journey taken alone, and that guidance, encouragement, and shared problem-solving support deeper learning and long-term improvement.  
**Vision:** Realizing that even simple autonomous behaviors can be the foundation for creating future robots that interact, respond, and grow alongside people.

🔄 Update (2025):
During portfolio preparation, I reviewed the wiring logic and corrected the motor polarity in the circuit diagram to support clearer understanding and future rebuilds. The hardware was not rebuilt; this was a clarification and documentation improvement.
