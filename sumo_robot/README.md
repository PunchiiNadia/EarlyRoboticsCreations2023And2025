# 🤖 Sumo Robot (2023)

This project was part of my early exploration of robotics, focusing on competitive motion control, sensor calibration, and 3D modeling. I co-designed and assembled a Sumo Robot capable of detecting ring edges and pushing opponents within a competition arena. Through this project, I strengthened both my technical foundation and emotional connection to robotics.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply foundational robotics knowledge by designing and assembling a competitive Sumo Robot. This project introduced hands-on experience in:

- 3D modeling and dimensional planning  
- Hardware placement and electronics integration  
- Sensor-based edge detection and motion control  
- Iterative refinement under real building conditions  

On a deeper level, this project helped me:

- Gaining confidence working with real hardware  
- Strengthening problem-solving skills during emotional and time pressure  
- Discovering the early beginning of my passion for **computer vision**, sparking by seeing sensors act like “eyes”

## 🧩 Role and Contribution

I worked under the guidance of my teacher throughout this project. My contributions included:

- **Primary 3D Designer:** I created the initial Tinkercad 3D model for the robot chassis and component alignment.
- **Guided Assembly Attempts:** I attempted to assemble wiring for motors and sensors. During this time, I was preparing to leave Thailand for the United States. The emotional and time pressure affected my ability to complete the wiring confidently. I took the robot home to continue trying but returned it in the same condition.
- **Calibration and Testing Observation:** I participated in adjusting motor speed and sensor thresholds during testing.
- **Code Understanding:** The complete working code was written by my teacher. I learned by tuning small logic parameters, such as speed values and detection limits, under his supervision.
- **Design Improvement Support:** My teacher helped improve the 3D design for better electronics fitting accuracy when time became limited near my departure.

Due to the short timeframe before I left Thailand, the final wiring completion, design refinements, and the complete working code implementation were completed by my teacher while maintaining the core structure of my original design.

I am deeply grateful for the patience, guidance, and encouragement I received.

## 🔧 Development Process

1. **3D Modeling** in Tinkercad  
2. **Fabrication** using 3D printing  
3. **Initial Component Assembly Attempts**  
4. **Testing and Calibration Observation**  
5. **Final Completion** by teacher due to limited time before departure

## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Response / How It Was Addressed |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| **Ensuring accurate electronic fit in the 3D model** | The fitting adjustments were completed by my teacher due to the time limitation. I closely observed how he refined the model to ensure proper spacing and secure component placement, and I am using this learning to improve my future 3D design planning and robotics builds. |
| **Understanding wiring logic** | The wiring was completed by my teacher due to the limited time before my departure. I learned by watching the process, asking questions, and observing how clear wiring logic prevents troubleshooting issues later. |
| **Sensor threshold calibration** | The calibration was led and finalized by my teacher. I participated by observing how different values affected detection stability and motion control during testing. |
| **Emotional and time pressure before international departure** | I learned to acknowledge my limits, ask for help sincerely, and accept steady progress instead of pushing myself alone during overwhelming circumstances. |

As the final wiring and functional code were completed by my teacher during the last stage of the project, I did not retain the full circuit diagram or code files. The working code remains with my teacher, and I sincerely respect and honor his authorship.

## ✅ Outcome

The robot successfully detected ring edges and pushed its opponent during operation.  
Although I was not able to complete all steps independently, this project became a meaningful foundation in developing a sense of inner strength, understanding robotics structure, and learning how sensors interact with the real world.

## 📌 Acknowledgment

**Special thanks to my teacher, *Nutthapon Buddhanu*,**  
for guiding and encouraging me throughout this project. He refined the 3D design for proper component fitting and completed the final wiring and calibration under a limited timeframe, ensuring that the robot could fully function before my departure to the United States.  

His effort allowed me to see my design come to life and to learn from a working robot, not only from the process. I deeply appreciate his thoughtfulness, dedication, time, and patience, especially during a period when time and emotions were both heavy. His support provided me assurance and inspiration to continue growing in robotics.
