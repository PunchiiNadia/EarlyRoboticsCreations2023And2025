# 🤖 Sumo Robot (2023)

This project was part of my early exploration of robotics, focusing on competitive motion control, sensor calibration, and 3D modeling. I co-designed and assembled a Sumo Robot capable of detecting ring edges and pushing opponents within a competition arena. Through this project, I strengthened both my technical foundation and emotional connection to robotics.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply foundational robotics knowledge by designing and assembling a competitive Sumo Robot. This project introduced hands-on experience in:

- 3D modeling and dimensional planning  
- Hardware placement and electronics integration  
- Sensor-based edge detection and motion control  
- Iterative refinement under real building conditions  

On a deeper level, this project helped me:

- Gain confidence working with real hardware  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills during emotional and time pressure  
- Discover the early beginning of my passion for **computer vision**, sparked by seeing sensors act like “eyes”

## 🧩 Role and Contribution

I worked under the guidance of my teacher throughout this project. My contributions included:

- **Primary 3D Designer:** I created the initial Tinkercad 3D model for the robot chassis and component alignment.
- **Guided Assembly Attempts:** I attempted to assemble wiring for motors and sensors. During this time, I was preparing to leave Thailand for the United States. The emotional and time pressure affected my ability to complete the wiring confidently. I took the robot home to continue trying but returned it in the same condition.
- **Calibration and Testing Observation:** I participated in adjusting motor speed and sensor thresholds during testing.
- **Code Understanding:** The complete working code was written by my teacher. I learned by tuning small logic parameters, such as speed values and detection limits, under his supervision.
- **Design Improvement Support:** My teacher helped improve the 3D design for better electronics fitting accuracy when time became limited near my departure.

Due to the short timeframe before I left Thailand, the final wiring completion, design refinements, and the complete working code implementation were completed by my teacher while maintaining the core structure of my original design.

I am deeply grateful for the patience, guidance, and encouragement I received.
