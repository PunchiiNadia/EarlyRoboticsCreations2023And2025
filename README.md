# PunchiiNadia-s-Early-Robotics-Creations
This repository showcases my early robotics creations, featuring 3D designs, circuit simulations, and Arduino code for the Obstacle Avoidance Robot, Sumo Robot, and Musical Birthday Box. Each project reflects my growth in uniting hardware, software, and empathy, exploring how engineering connects creativity, logic, and human meaning.
