## 🔍 Overview

This collection includes three Arduino-based projects that reflect my exploration of robotics fundamentals, problem-solving, and human-centered design. From autonomous motion to interactive systems, these works highlight how machines can connect logic with compassion.

### Included Projects
1. **Obstacle Avoidance Robot**  
   My first self-directed robotics project, designed to detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. It taught me perseverance, wiring logic, and how hardware connects with software.

2. **Sumo Robot**  
   A collaborative project focused on 3D design, calibration, and motor control. It strengthened my design foundation and sparked my interest in computer vision and robot perception.

3. **Musical Birthday Box**  
   A heartfelt creation that combines Arduino programming with synchronized LED lights to play the *Happy Birthday* melody. Designed as a gift for my mother, this project reminded me that technology can express care and creativity.
