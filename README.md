# 🤖 Early Robotics Creations (2023 & 2025)

This repository showcases my early robotics creations that mark the beginning of my journey in engineering, design, and coding. Each project was built from curiosity and persistence, combining technical learning with creativity and emotion.

## 🔍 Overview

This collection includes three Arduino-based projects that reflect my exploration of robotics fundamentals, problem-solving, and human-centered design. From autonomous motion to interactive systems, these works highlight how machines can connect logic with compassion.

### Included Projects
1. **Obstacle Avoidance Robot**  
   Building by following and adapting a YouTube tutorial, this robot detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. It was my first project applying the Arduino fundamentals I had learned, helping me connect theory to practice. Through experimenting with wiring corrections, motor adjustments, and battery upgrades, I improved its performance, though it only achieved partial success in navigation. This hands-on process provided me valuable experience with Arduino hardware and programming, and taught me how iteration and collaboration are key to meaningful learning.

2. **Sumo Robot**  
   A collaborative project focused on 3D modeling, calibration, and motor control. I co-designed and assembled the robot using Tinkercad and Arduino, refining design accuracy and wiring logic under teacher guidance. This project strengthened my technical foundation and emotional connection to robotics, sparking my passion for computer vision and the idea of creating technology that perceives and connects with the world.

3. **Musical Birthday Box**  
   A heartfelt creation that combines Arduino programming with synchronized LED lights to play the *Happy Birthday* melody. I first simulated the circuit and code in Tinkercad before assembling the system as a gift for my mother. This project reminded me that engineering can carry emotion, turning circuits and lights into a reflection of care, memory, and human warmth.
