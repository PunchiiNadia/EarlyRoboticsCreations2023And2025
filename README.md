## 🔍 Overview

This collection includes three Arduino-based projects that reflect my exploration of robotics fundamentals, problem-solving, and human-centered design. From autonomous motion to interactive systems, these works highlight how machines can connect logic with compassion.

### Included Projects
1. **Obstacle Avoidance Robot**  
   Building by following and adapting a YouTube tutorial, this robot detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. Through experimenting with wiring corrections and motor adjustments, I gained hands-on experience with Arduino hardware and learned how hardware and software interact.

2. **Sumo Robot**  
   A collaborative project focused on 3D design, calibration, and motor control. It strengthened my design foundation and sparked my interest in computer vision and robot perception.

3. **Musical Birthday Box**  
   A heartfelt creation that combines Arduino programming with synchronized LED lights to play the *Happy Birthday* melody. Designed as a gift for my mother, this project reminded me that technology can express care and creativity.
