# 🎁 Musical Birthday Box (2023)

This project combines creativity, electronics, and personal meaning. I designed and built an Arduino-based musical gift box that plays the Happy Birthday melody with synchronized LED lights as a birthday surprise for my mother. It represents the beginning of how I learned to use engineering to express care, emotion, and human warmth.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply early electronics and Arduino programming skills to create a meaningful gift.  
The goal was to design a box that:

- Played the Happy Birthday tune  
- Displayed synchronized LED lighting  
- Created a warm and memorable moment  

On a deeper level, this project helped me understand how technology can be used to express love and create emotional connection.


## 🧩 Role and Contribution

I worked on this project as both the circuit designer and creative developer, guided by my robotics teacher.

My contributions included:

- Designing and simulating the circuit in Tinkercad  
- Programming the Happy Birthday melody in Arduino IDE  
- Wiring the buzzer, LEDs, and resistors to the breadboard and Arduino  
- Building and decorating the birthday box for presentation  

My teacher introduced me to Tinkercad and Arduino, guiding my early learning and encouraging me to explore beyond the classroom. I also referred to online tutorials while my teacher continued to challenge me to refine and improve the system each day. These experiences opened my imagination to create this project and inspired my ongoing journey in robotics.


## ⚙️ Tools and Components

- Arduino Uno  
- Piezo Buzzer (1x)  
- LEDs (4x)  
- Resistors  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  
- Decorative crafting materials  
- Tinkercad for simulation and planning  
- Arduino IDE / C++ for programming

## 🔧 Development Process

1. Planning: Researched piezo buzzer tone frequencies and LED control.  
2. Simulation: Designed and tested the circuit in Tinkercad before real hardware assembly.  
3. Assembly: Wired the buzzer and LEDs to the Arduino and breadboard.  
4. Programming: Coded the Happy Birthday melody and synchronized LED flashes.  
5. Testing: Adjusted tone frequencies and LED timing until the song played smoothly.  
6. Fabrication and Presentation: Built a layered birthday box, decorated it, and prepared the surprise setting for my mother.


## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Tone accuracy | At first, all notes sounded similar. By researching buzzer tone frequency charts and testing values, I refined the melody until it sounded correct. |
| Wiring confusion as a beginner | With patient guidance from my teacher and feedback from classmates, I corrected board wiring and gained clearer understanding of breadboard logic. |
| Balancing time with schoolwork | I worked steadily in the evenings, focusing on small improvements each day. |


## ✅ Outcome

The project successfully produced the correct Happy Birthday melody with synchronized LED lighting.  
My mother smiled warmly and said thank you.  
Her joy reminded me that technology can create connection and express care.
